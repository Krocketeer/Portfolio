            <p> I am currently an undergraduate studying
                <a href="https://www.hcde.washington.edu/"> Human Centered Design & Engineering </a>
                at the University of Washington. My journey in design first started when I took an introductory course
                about inclusive design. It wasn't until then that I started to think about how important designing for
                all users is. As someone who grew up in a very diverse neighborhood of different
                ages, races, and abilities, I realized that each of us were unique in our own ways. Our backgrounds and
                lived experiences ultimately make us who we are and as a result, I strive to create equitable
                and inclusive experiences for all.
            </p>
            <p> When I'm not designing, you can find me outside taking photographs, swimming, or exploring what it
                means to be a human :)
