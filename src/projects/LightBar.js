                            <h6>Background</h6>
                            <p> I was sitting at my desk on a Zoom meeting when I realized that my background was too
                                dark for others to be able to see my face clearly. Not wanting to distract people, I
                                turned off my camera, walked over the the LED light bar I had directly behind me to turn
                                it on. After noting how annoying it was for me to turn off my camera in order to get up
                                and turn on my light, I then realized this problem would make for an intersting project.
                                Instead of needing to turn off my camera and get up to turn on my lights, I could
                                instead integrate an Arduino into the light bar so that I could control the lights right
                                from my desk.

                                I knew there were going to be many components of the project that needed to be figured
                                out before building the full thing. I decided to start off by building a small version
                                of project by making a simple circuit that switched between two LEDs on the press of
                                two different [keyboard] switches (essentially buttons). It was pretty straight forward
                                on how to do this since I had done so before for various homework assignments in my
                                physical computing class. Because of that I decided to take this opportunity to flesh
                                out more of the code that would be used in the final version and integrating a
                                transistor since I would eventually need to do so for the LED bar.

                                After I got my switches to work as intended with the basic version (both circuit and
                                code wise), it was now time to incorporate the light bar into the Arduino itself.
                                Opening up the light bar's original switch, I desoldered the wires and then connected it
                                to my Arduino using two N-Channel MOSFIT transistors like I had for the smaller LED
                                light strip. However, it soon became very apparent that something was wrong since when
                                both transistors were connected, only the white LEDs of the light bar turned on and I
                                could not switch to the blue LEDs. I couldn't even turn off the light bar with both
                                transistors connected; I was only able to turn off and on one of the LED strips when one
                                transistor was connected.

                                After a few days of not knowing why this was happening, I was informed that I needed
                                P-Channel MOSFET transistors since the light bar had common power instead of common ground
                                like most other circuits in the world. I eventually figured out this was because the way
                                the light bar was designed — the VCC of the power adaptor was connected to both
                                positive leads of the white and blue LED strips, hence common power. Once I had acquired
                                two P-Channel transistors (which was kind of an adventure to do since RadioShacks virtually
                                no longer exist), I hooked them up into the circuit and nothing happened. Strange.
                                Reaching out to course instructors for more assistance, I ended up working with my
                                professor for a little over two hours in order to get the transistors to work properly.
                                Using <a href={links.pChannelTutorial}> this
                                tutorial </a> as a guide, we were successfully able to power the original LED light
                                strip (as a basic tester) with P-Channel transistors! This meant that everything was
                                ready to integrate with the actual light bar. Though, what was interesting was that we
                                connected the VCC of the power adapter into the 5V pin of the Arduino, which is
                                typically a no-go since that would fry the Arduino. However, since I was using P-Channel
                                transistors, the 5V and the VCC had to be connected but it was okay as long as I did not
                                connect their respective grounds together.

                                Using the same <a href={links.pChannelTutorial}> tutorial </a> and the basic circuit as
                                a guide, I then created the schematic for my light bar. Each button is connected with a
                                10 kΩ resistor since that practically guarantees I would have a current close to 0 amps
                                (.0005A = 5V / 10 kΩ) when each button isn't pressed to avoid having a
                                <a href={links.floatingPin}> floating pin</a>. 10 kΩ resistors were also added between
                                the Gate terminal and the VCC to ensure that each transistor remained off when it's
                                supposed to be off, like the buttons. In addition, 100Ω resistors were connected between
                                the Gate and each digital output pin of the respective transistor since transistors have
                                a small internal capacitance that would damage the Arduino if left alone. No additional
                                resistors were needed for the LED light bar since they were built into the light bar
                                itself.

                                With both the basic circuit and the switches ready, I then set out to combine them so
                                that they would work together. It was pretty straightforward doing so since I built each
                                of them on separate breadboards and only needed a few wires to connect them together.

                                I coded the switches, using
                                <a href={links.debounceExample}> Debounce </a>
                                as the starter code, so that one switch would turn off both LEDs, another switch would
                                turn on one LED, and the last switch would turn on the other LED. If you pressed the
                                same switch while the LED was on, the LED would turn off. If LED A was on and you
                                pressed the switch for LED B, then LED B would turn on. While I had fleshed out the
                                majority of this code earlier on when I was testing out the switches with the RGB LED
                                and the LED light strip, something wasn't working quite right with the light bar
                                attached. When everything was connected and powered on the first time, the light bar
                                turned on when it was originally coded to be off. In addition, when I tried to switch
                                between which LED was on, I would need to press the button twice before it swapped
                                correctly. This was then that I realized since I had used a P-Channel transistor,
                                using <span style={{backgroundColor: "#e7e7e7", fontFamily: "Fira Code"}}>
                                    digitalWrite(pinNumber, HIGH)
                                </span> meant the light bar turns off and
                                using <span style={{backgroundColor: "#e7e7e7", fontFamily: "Fira Code"}}>
                                    digitalWrite(pinNumber, LOW)
                                </span> meant the light bar turns on. After swapping all
                                my <span style={{backgroundColor: "#e7e7e7", fontFamily: "Fira Code"}}>
                                    HIGH

                                Once the circuit was working properly, it was now time to integrate it into a product.
                                The first part was finding something to house the Arduino and the bread board in. I
                                immediately thought of boxes and was lucky enough to find an old sunglasses box that
                                could fit everything (even luckier was that the box was black which made it more sleek).
                                Using a box cutter, I cut out slots for the USB wire of the Arduino, the AC adapter,
                                and the wires that connected to the switches. Once that was done, it was now for the
                                tedious part of soldering hookup wire to the switches and to the light bar so that
                                everything could fit together. Now this wasn't my first time soldering, and the fact
                                that I soldered a couple of other things this quarter made this process go by a lot
                                faster. That being said, the most annoying part was having to deal with 6 wires, at 22
                                feet each, since I needed a way to have the switches stay on my desk but connect to the
                                Arduino behind me. I ended up breaking a few of the switches as I was sorting through
                                the tangled mess of wires which forced me to resolder new switches the wires a few
                                times. Finally, after what was a tedious six hour process, I was able to tape the wires
                                around my door frame, hook everything up to the Arduino, and connect it all to power.

                                After everything was connected, I now had a fully functional way to control my LED light
                                that I could control from my desk! While it took many hours of work to accomplish, it
                                was finally finished and I can now attend Zoom meetings with good lighting, all without
                                having to leave my desk.
