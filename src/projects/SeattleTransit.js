                        <p> Living in a high density city often means using public transportation as a way of commuting.
                            Whether it’s traveling to school, to work, or anything in between, a city’s public
                            transportation service must be extensive enough to support its community. For the city of
                            Seattle, two transit agencies — King County Metro and Sound Transit — fulfills the community’s
                            public transportation needs. King County Metro operates the majority of the local busses within
                            the city while Sound Transit operates regional busses in addition to the city’s rail service.
                            While both agencies serve the city of Seattle, they both maintain a different visual branding
                            on their buses and rail service from each other. This often causes confusion for out of city
                            visitors and generally those who are not familiar with how public transit works in Seattle. </p>

                    <h6>The Goal</h6>
                    <p> The rebrand of King County Metro and Sound Transit aims to unify the
                        two into one cohesive brand that represents Seattle public transit. </p>
                </div>
                <div id="moodBoard">
                    <h6>Setting the Mood</h6>
                    <div style={styles.centerDiv50}>
                        <p> The first step in creating a rebrand for Seattle public transit was figuring out what feeling
                            the rebrand should embody. I chose images that represent the lively night life of Seattle and
                            the numerous rich-nature colors that exist in and around the city. Particularly, I wanted to
                            incorporate things and places that were iconic to Seattle, such as Pike Place Market, and be
                            able to represent them in the rebrand. </p>
                        <img id="SeaTransMoodBoard" src={moodBoard} alt="Mood board"/>
                        {/*<figcaption className="caption">Visual representation of the direction for the rebrand of Seattle public transit</figcaption>*/}
                    </div>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <h6>Colors</h6>

                        <p style={{paddingBottom: "25px"}}>
                            Inspired by the mood board, the color palette pulls from many
                            of the vibrant imagery that exists in and around the city. Midnight serves as a base color that
                            many Seattlites are used to while ocean blue, blizzard blue, and minty green act as an accent
                            that is visible in bright and dark environments. Pine green and slate purple were chosen to
                            stand out against the other blues and greens while still being cohesive with the
                            color scheme. </p>

                    <h6>Typography</h6>
                    <div style={styles.centerDiv50}>
                        <p> One of the main ways to communicate information towards riders of Seattle public transit is
                            through text. As a result, the typefaces of the text need to be visually distinct enough for
                            riders to be able to read, even if they are rushing to get where they are going. Cabin was
                            chosen for its modern look while being bold enough to catch riders’ eyes. Open Sans was chosen
                            as the font pairs well with Cabin, creating a cohesive system.
                        </p>

                    <h6>User Flows & Low-Fi Designs</h6>
                    <div style={styles.centerDiv}>
                        <p style={{paddingBottom: "25px"}}>
                            Before designing a mobile and kiosk application for Seattle public transit, a user flow was
                            created out of interviews and observations to reflect the needs of riders. User flows focused
                            on core functionalities of a mobile and kiosk application that could best serve riders in their
                            commutes. The user flows then served as a grounding base for me as I created low-fidelity
                            designs of the mobile and kiosk applications.

                        <p> One of the core visual aspects of a design is the usage of icons. Icons were selected based
                            on their clarity in helping riders understand information at a quick glance, either in person
                            or on an application.

                        <p> Equipped with a visual system and low-fidelity designs, I then created high-fidelity
                            wireframes of a mobile and kiosk application for Seattle public transit as well as an
                            interactive prototype. These wireframes focused on functionality, while maintaining a
                            simple and elegant design.  (Not working? Click here to view

                            An essential part of public transit is the usage of wayfinding in order to help riders navigate
                            the public transit system. Wayfinding signs were created to be big and visually distinct so
                            that riders can easily understand the information on the signs as they are heading to their
                            destination. In addition, the ORCA card was updated to a more modern and simplistic design to
                            compliment the styles shown in the rebrand. </p>
